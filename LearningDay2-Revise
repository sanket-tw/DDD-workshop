1.Covered domain service,
2. Factory
3. Aggregate

aggregate- define a clear boundary and ownership,
it is a group of objects
entity becomes a aggregate,
root is always an entity
agrregate root entity Id becomes global identifier, and other ids of other objects inside aggregate become local identifier

on a rough guideline, every aggregate identifies as a microservice

good practice: don't tie up entities directly, make it flat

convert one aggregate to multiple aggregate, so make it from transactional ACID to eventual consistency
